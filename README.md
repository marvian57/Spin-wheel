# Spin-wheel

This is a custom One Piece–themed spin wheel built for a potential TikTok project.
The wheel randomly selects multiple chracter-based attributes from multiple tiers.

This app also includes sound effects (tick on each segment, final-choice sound) and a final animation.
Currently everything uses math-based probability, but I plan to rework it into pure geometry-based weighting (bigger slice = higher chance).
